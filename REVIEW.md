# Reviewer grounding: Garnet Runtime Review

The PR description contains a `Runtime evidence (Garnet)` section between
`<!-- garnet:evidence:begin -->` and `<!-- garnet:evidence:end -->`. When it
contains a head-bound record, the section is a verbatim mirror of the trusted
Garnet Runtime Review comment. Treat that record as ground truth of what the
recorded run observed, then cross-check it against what the diff implies.

## Open with a grounding verdict

Start the review body with one line stating the grounding conclusion for this
PR:

> **Runtime grounding** (head `<sha7>`): <what the recorded run showed against
> what this diff should do>

When the record is stale, pending, or absent, the verdict says that instead
and the review proceeds from the diff alone:

> **Runtime grounding**: record bound to `<old7>`, head is `<sha7>` — stale,
> not used
>
> **Runtime grounding**: no runtime evidence for this head

One or two sentences. State whether the recorded behavior matches what this
diff should do — the conclusion, not a restatement of the record.

## Grounding rules

1. Read the `<!-- garnet:commit <sha> -->` marker. Use the mirrored record only
   when that SHA equals the PR head. A different SHA, a missing section, or a
   pending section is no runtime evidence, not a clean run.
2. Use the `<!-- garnet:summary {...} -->` marker as the machine register. It
   is contract-versioned and keeps chain counts that do not render on the
   human surface. On snapshot comments, `previous` is `null`; branch on that
   field instead of treating the job partition as a comparison.
3. An execution chain is one root-to-action path. Today's action class is an
   outbound connection. A destination is the leaf of an outbound action and
   never the definition of a chain. Do not use “process chain” or “process
   lineage”.
4. The headline is `Execution Profiles recorded for <N> job(s)`. Never claim
   true k-of-n coverage. Runtime Review records observed execution; it does not
   establish that a fixed fraction of jobs ran.
5. In a comparison, `+` is new in the current record and `−` is only in the
   previous record. Cross-check those observations against the diff.
   On this repository's dependency changes, expect npm registry traffic (`registry.npmjs.org`); browser-download CDN edges vary between runs and are not by themselves a behavioral finding.
   Flag any recorded destination or execution chain the change does not
   explain. Do not
   treat a missing record as absence of behavior.
6. Never repeat verdicts, scores, severities, baseline classifications, or
   safety judgments from Garnet. Derive review judgment from the diff.
7. Prefix every runtime-grounded statement exactly with:
   `Runtime evidence (Garnet, head <sha7>): `
   Include the observed execution chain, destination, workflow/job, and the
   Execution Profile URL when one is present.

The mirror is delivery, not a summary. Do not paraphrase or dilute the
verbatim evidence region.

## Public machine surface

The logged-out machine surface also exists today:
`https://app.garnet.ai/api/public/runs/<run_id>?profile=<profile_id>` returns
`200 application/json` with `schema_version: runtime-review-public/v3`. The
HTML permalink does not content-negotiate (`Accept: application/json` still
returns HTML), and a `.json` suffix returns 404. Use the marker and linked
profile deliberately; do not invent an API URL when the comment does not
provide one.
